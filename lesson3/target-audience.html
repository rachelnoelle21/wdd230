                downtown. Whether these people are from Idaho Falls or not, they all have something 
                in common; they all love to look at the Idaho Falls temple.
                </p>

                <p>First Scenario: Where is the best place to eat in downtown Idaho Falls? <br>
                The best place to eat is a new restaurant called Smokin Fins in Idaho Falls. It 
                is located near the river. It serves everything from fish and chips to 52-day 
                aged Ribeye.

                <p>Second Scenario: What stores are located near downtown Idaho Falls? <br>
                The shops located downtown are unique and not at all common. The best shops
                include Poppy and Pout Boutique, The Handmade Idaho Shop, and Lemon Meringue.
                All of these shops sell cute items from clothing to trinkets.
